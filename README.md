# Genrot
Genrot, or Genre Bot, is a program that mashes up words in order to create new genres and post them to Twitter. AKA another shitposting bot.
Grabs a word from a random word api and mashes it with suffixes defined by a file. Contains a blacklist for words you wouldn't want to be cancelled for.
